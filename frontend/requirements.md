## Packages
framer-motion | Page transitions and sequential workflow animations
lucide-react | Professional iconography for the legal dashboard

## Notes
- No backend integration required; all workflow logic is simulated in the client using `setTimeout` to mimic AI processing delays.
- Using a professional legal-tech theme: Dark navy blue, slate, and crisp white.
- Fonts: 'Playfair Display' for authoritative headings, 'Inter' for highly readable dashboard data.
